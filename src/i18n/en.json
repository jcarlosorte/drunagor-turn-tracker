    "ABSORCION": "Draining is resource stealing. When a characters drains something from a Target, it means that the drained character loses whatever is being drained and then gives it to the draining character. Draining Health is not the same as dealing damage, so this effect can't be responded to with Reactions.",
    "AC_ALCANCE_DE_CUBO": "This term refers to the Range of an effect, which is defined by the color of the cube spent to use the Skill or Reaction that cast it.",
    "ACCION_DE_CUBO": "This is the name given to actions that a Hero takes by spending an Action Cube. During their turn, a Hero can perform up to two Cube Actions. Some special actions can be considered as one of these Cube Actions, such as, for example, the purchase of an additional Move Action by Expending an AC. Reactions are not considered Cube Actions.",
    "ACCION_DE_RECOBRAR_GRATUITA": "A Free Recall Action is a Recall Action (see page 20) that can be taken without generating the Curse Cube penalty to the Hero who took it.",
    "ACUMULABLE": "Acumulable means that a character can have up to 4 copies of a same token with this trait in their sheet/card. A 2-sided token showing 1 and 2 must always be considered as if it was the number of separate tokens indicated. If a character would receive a fifth token from a stackable effect, it is ignored. Example: 2 Focus 2 tokens counts as 4 Focus 1 tokens.",
    "ADYACENTE": "This effect can only affect a Target in an adjacent square to the casting Character, regardless of the Skill's Range.",
    "ALCANCE_X": "You receive X additional movement points every time you receive a Move effect.",
    "ANDANADA_X": "A character with this ability, when activated, will make its move and then attack two times (it won't move twice or move between attacks). Each attack must be resolved separately and may be reacted to individually. If a character becomes out of range between attacks, the Monster may choose another target for its last attack as long as it doesn't have to move.",
    "APARTAR": "When 2 characters are going to occupy the same space and one has priority over the other, we say that the first one pushes the second. When a character is pushed, it is Moved to a square adjacent to the area (blue square) that it occupied before. The Group Leader chooses where a Monster will be pushed, while a pushed Hero chooses their new position. Characters suffer the effects from stepping on harmful terrain when they are pushed into them (if they haven't suffered them already this turn).",
    "ARROLLAR_X": "Arrollar es una mejora de Movimiento. Un personaje que arrolla puede atravesar pero no terminar su Movimiento en casillas ocupadas por enemigos, AdemÃ¡s, cuando atraviesan a personajes enemigos de esta manera, les infligen X de daÃ±o no prevenible. Un personaje no puede arrollar a un mismo personaje mÃ¡s de 1 vez por efecto de Movimiento.",
    "ATAQUE_CON_ARMA": "This Skill is an attack using your Weapon. You must roll the D20 to see if the attack is successful or a failure. Weapon Attacks can score Critical Hits and Critical Failures.",
    "ATAQUE_CON_HECHIZO": "This Skill is a magic spell or ability that inflicts damage. This type of damage is always a success, so no attack roll is needed-the target simply suffers the effect.",
    "ATAQUE_DOBLE": "A Monster with this ability, when activated, will make its move and then attack two times (it won't move twice or move between attacks). Each attack must be resolved separately and may be reacted to individually.

If a character becomes out of range between attacks, the Monster may choose another target for its last attack as long as it doesn't have to move.",
    "AURA": "Aura is a reward related to a choice a character made during the story. Auras usually give special abilities as if they were some kind of blessing. A character can have only one Aura noted on their Campaign Log and they are removed when either the character receives a new Aura (which replaces the old one) or is knocked out and receives a Trauma Cube. Auras are not removed during the Camp Phase.",

    "BRUTAL": "The damage caused by this Attack of Monster is non-preventable.",
    "CODICIA": "A Monster with Covetous Targets the Hero that is holding more Resource tokens (FOCUS, SHIELD, and Kl are examples) as its Primary Target. If two Heroes are tied with the same number of Resource tokens, a Monster with Covetous targets the one among them who occupies the fastest Initiative Slot.",
    "COMPANEROS": "In addition to Pets, the Heroes may also encounter valuable allies during their journey, called Companions. Companions do not have Health. Instead, they have a value called 'Sturdiness.' In short, they are only defeated if they take damage that exceeds this value all at once. Companions are seen as Pets in the eyes of the Monsters (they will be targeted as their last priority, only when the Monster cannot attack a Hero in their place). Companions can hold SHIELD tokens and receive PREVENT effects like any character. Companions are activated after the turn of the Hero they are following and their turn consists of a Move Action and an Attack Action, in that order, in the same way as a Monster. Companions are discharged during the Camp Phase.",
    "CONCENTRACION_X": "The Target gains X FOCUS tokens, which they can later spend to use Focus Abilities. FOCUS is a stackable resource.",
    "CONSECUENCIA": "A Consequence is a game state received by an important choice made by a player during the story. Many Interactions can have different outcomes depending on the Consequences that the Heroes are holding in their Campaign Logs. Consequences are only erased when another Interaction resolution orders them to.",
    "CONSUMIR": "Expend is a type of resource loss When you must Expend Action Cubes, move an available Action Cube to your Expended Action Cubes box on your Hero board. An expended AC can be recalled as normal but it cannot be spent to use Skills while it is there.",
    "CRITICO_X": "If you roll X or more on your D20 during an attack roll, you inflict a Critical Hit! A Critical Hit does double the normal damage, but does not inflict double the Conditions.",
    "CUBO_COMODIN": "A Wild Cube is an Action Cube that can be used as if it were any color you choose. When a Wild Cube is spent to use one of your Hero Skills (not Dungeon Roles or Equipment), any number written in its effect is doubled. Example: A Wild Cube was used to activate a: 'SELF, HEAL 2 AND SHIELD 4' Skill. Doubling these numbers we would give 'SELF, HEAL 4 AND SHIELD 8'. Since SHIELD tokens are stackable, receiving SHIELD 8 would be a waste, but the HEAL 4 would not.",
    "CUBOS_DE_ACCION": "Action Cubes are the colored cubes spent by Heroes to use their Skills.",
    "CUBOS_DE_MALDICION": "Curse Cubes are the black cubes that represent the influence of Darkness on a Hero's willpower. When received, a Curse Cube must be allocated to a Hero or Dungeon Role Skill and as long as it remains there, that Skill is blocked and cannot be used. When a Hero receives their sixth CC, they are considered corrupted and the Adventure ends in failure.",
    "CUBOS_DE_TRAUMA": "Trauma Cubes represent a deep wound suffered by the Hero. When received, a Trauma Cube must be allocated to a Hero Skill or Dungeon Role Skill and for as long as it remains there, that Skill is blocked and cannot be used. When a Hero receives their second TC, they are considered killed and the Adventure ends in failure.",
    "DANO_X": "The X value is added to the damage your attack inflicts. Critical Hits and DOUBLE DAMAGE also doubles this damage.",
    "DERRIBO": "The Target receives a KNOCK DOWN token. Unlike other Conditions, KNOCK DOWN does not take effect at the beginning of the character's next turn, it lingers until removed instead. The next time the affected character receives a Move effect, it cancels that effect and removes their KNOCK DOWN token from their board. KNOCK DOWN is a redundant Condition.",
    "DESAFIO": "A Monster with Defiant Targets the Most Vigorous Hero (the one with most available Action Cubes at the moment) as its Primary Target.",
    "DESARME": "A Hero that suffers from DISARM must immediately EXPEND all of their available Melee and Ranged Action Cubes. This effect is considered to be FATIGUE (characters that are immune to FATIGUE, are also immune to DISARM and it does not trigger any abilities that wouldn't be triggered by FATIGUE effects as well.)",
    "DESCARTAR": "Discard is a type of resource loss. When you must discard something, remove it from your board.",
    "DIVIDIR": "The character that casts the Spell may choose to divide the described effect between any number of targets (within Range) they choose. To be considered a target, a character must receive at least 1 point of the effect. Any bonuses the character has apply to the total amount, not to each target they choose. Example: A HEAL +1 bonus applied to a DIVIDE, HEAL 4 effect would result in DIVIDE, HEAL 5 instead of 4 separate HEAL 2 effects.",
    "EFECTO_DE_COPIA": "Some Skills copy the effects of another Hero Skill. A copy has exactly all the effects of the copied Skill, including its base Range regardless of the color of the cube used to copy it (if you used a Wisdom Skill to copy a Ranged one, the copy's Range will be 1, not unlimited). Unless otherwise stated, Dungeon Role or Equipment Skills and Reactions cannot be copied.",
    "ELEMENTO": "Any piece on the table that is not a board, tray, or Bridge is considered an element. Some may be SOLID ELEMENTS (see below) and follow special rules, while others are not, such as Traps, Darkness tiles, and any that you are instructed to place on the board and specified as such. Characters can move through and end their Movement on top of elements that are not considered solid.",
    "ELEMENTOS_SÃ“LIDOS": "A Solid Element is a piece (a token, a miniature, etc.) that occupies a square. Characters cannot end their Movement on top of them or cross them if they are their enemies (when these Solid Elements are characters). Characters, Chest and Interaction tokens, Rune piles, Runes, NPC tokens, and other special elements that you are instructed to place on the board and identified as Solid Elements are considered as such.",
    "EMBATE_X": "Cleave is a type of area effect that targets entire areas (blue square) instead of a single target (square). CLEAVE X means that you must choose X areas within Range and affect each character you choose within them. A Melee CLEAVE X means that the character must choose areas that have 1 of their squares adjacent to them. Similarly, a CLEAVE X with Range 1 (RANGE 1, CLEAVE X) means that the character chooses X areas within Range 1, while a CLEAVE with unlimited Range means that they choose areas anywhere on the board.",
    "EMBOSCADA": "A Monster with Ambush slips through reality, teleporting from one point to another instead of walking. When a Monster ambushes, remove it from the board. Then, the character that is its Primary Target (or its controller if it is a Companion or Pet) chooses an unoccupied square adjacent to them to place the Monster. If it is harmful Terrain, the Monster suffers its effects as if it had landed on it with JUMP.",
    "EMPUJON_X": "Move the target X squares away from you. You can only KNOCKBACK a target with the same base size as you or smaller (unless the Skill says otherwise). You move the target in a straight line in a direction of your choice and each square they Move must be away from you. The character is knocked back until they travel the indicated squares or hit an obstacle, which can be another solid element, the edge of a Dungeon tray with a higher level (they may fall to a lower one), or the end of a board placed on level 0.",
    "ENEMIGO": "Any character that is not in your party and is not an NPC Token is considered an enemy. Monsters are the Heroes' enemies and vice-versa.",
    "ESCUDO_X": "The target gains X SHIELD tokens. Each SHIELD token can be used to cancel 1 point of damage against the character. You must use all of your SHIELD tokens before losing Health or using a PREVENT effect. You cannot choose to take the damage and keep your SHIELD tokens or PREVENT the damage with another Skill to keep them. SHIELD tokens are a stackable resource.",
    "ESTADO": "A State is a reward related to a character's decision during the story. Some grant special Abilities, like a kind of blessing, and others are only related to the story. In any case, a character can have any number of States noted in their Campaign Journal and all are erased during the next Camp Phase.",
    "EVOLUCION": "This Monster gets stronger during the battle. When a Monster EVOLVES, give it a +2 DMG and +1 MOVE token (keep these tokens on its matching color on the Monster Status Board). These benefits are cumulative and they are not considered to be Conditions.",
    "FATIGA_X": "A Hero that suffers from FATIGUE must immediately EXPEND X of their available Action Cubes for no effect. If they do not have enough AC's, they must Expend all of their current available Action Cubes and consider the effect resolved.",
    "FIRMEZA": "Sturdiness is the ability of Companions to withstand hits. Any damage dealt by a single hit to this character up to this value is ignored as if it had been canceled (even non-preventable). However, if the damage manages to exceed this value by at least 1 point, the character is defeated. Heroes can use their PREVENT Skills to mitigate damage that is going to exceed a Companion's Sturdiness and can give them SHIELD tokens (remembering that they are spent the first time the Companion would take damage, not only when this damage would exceed their Sturdiness).",
    "FRUTO_DE_VIDA": "With a Use a Consumable Item Minor Action, a character holding a FRUIT OF LIFE may discard it to: SELF, HEAL 2. Additionally, these fruits are considered items and may be exchanged with other Heroes like any other item would normally be, but they do not occupy any bag space. FRUIT OF LIFE is a stackable resource.",
    "FURIA": "When you hit with a Spell Attack or Weapon Attack, you may discard 1 FURY to add +1 DMG to your Attack. You may discard only 1 FURY token per turn or Reaction (If you have an ability that is also a Reaction, for example). FURY is a stackable resource.",
    "HEMORRAGIA_X": "The target receives X BLEED tokens. At the start of that character's next turn, they take 1 non-preventable damage for each BLEED token they have and then remove all BLEED tokens from their sheet. BLEED is a stackable Condition.",
    "HENDEDURA_X": "This Attack can target up to X enemies adjacent to the Attacker (they do not need to be adjacent to each other). Heroes only make 1 Attack roll and apply its result to all characters they Attack.",
    "HEROE_MAS_CANSADO": "The Hero with the fewest available Action Cubes is the Weakest Hero. If two Heroes are tied with the fewest available Action Cubes, the Weakest one among them will be the slowest one on the Initiative tracker.",
    "HEROE_MAS_CORRUPTO": "The Hero with the most Curse Cubes is the Most Corrupted Hero. If two Heroes are tied with the most Curse Cubes, the Most Corrupted one among them will be the fastest one on the Initiative tracker.",

    "HOSTIGAR": "A Pet with this ability freely returns to a square adjacent to its master (of its choice) after attacking. That character won't be affected by any square it flies by, but it will be affect by the one adjacent to its master since it has to land on it.",
    "IMPACTAR_X": "This is the instruction for your Hero to make a Weapon Attack adding (or subtracting) the X value to your die roll. Keep in mind that this bonus affects...",
    "IMPLACABLE": "A Relentless Monster chooses the Weakest Hero (the one with the fewest available Action Cubes at the moment) as its Primary Target.",
    "INMUNIDAD": "The character cannot be affected by the named Condition or Effect. Not being affected by a Condition means that you don't even get their tokens when exposed to it. In particular, immunity to STEALTH has additional meanings: The character can Target hidden characters as normal, and they can't be Surprised by hidden characters.",
    "INTIMIDAR_X": "A Character has X DMG for each INTIMIDATE token they are holding.",
    "KI": "As a Minor Action, you may discard 1 Kl token to make 1 Weapon Attack ( ) with +0 HIT. Whether you spend Kl to make a Weapon Attack or to use any other Ability you have learned, you can only discard 1 per turn or Reaction (If you have an ability that is also a Reaction, for example). Kl is a stackable resource.",
    "LENTITUD": "The target receives a SLOW token. Unlike other Conditions, it does not take effect at the start of their next turn, but remains until it is removed. The next time the affected character would receive a Movement effect, they lose 2 points of Movement from that effect and remove the SLOW token from their sheet. SLOW is a Redundant Condition.",
    "MALDICION_X": "The target gains X Curse Cubes. Unlike Curse Cubes received from Recalling, CURSE is an effect and as such, there are Abilities that can give you immunity to this specific effect, but that do not prevent you from receiving Curse Cubes in any other way.",
    "MANDO": "This Monster incites another to fight. When a Monster commands, the Strongest Monster that is not the Commanding Monster is immediately Activated (as if it were its turn).",
    "MANIFESTAR": "Summon is an effect that evokes the chaotic power of Darkness. To Summon, a player must randomly draw a Rune from the bag and reveal it to the other players. It is not considered to \"draw\" the Rune and thus does not generate a Darkness tile or trigger any Ability associated with drawing Runes. Once the Rune is revealed, whoever Summoned it activates a special effect based on that Rune's color. Then, the Summoned Rune is returned to the bag, without being placed on the Initiative tracker.",
    "MARCA_DE_MONTARAZ": "When a character is marked with this effect, they receive a MARK token. All of the Ranger's Weapon and Spell Attacks against a character they have marked deal +1 DMG. As seen before, this damage is doubled if the character scores a Critical Hit.",

    "MATANZA": "A Monster with Slaughter chooses NPC tokens (not Companions) as its Primary Target.",
    "MONSTRUO_GRANDE": "This Monster is considered to be Large (even if their base size is Small). Large Monsters are immune to KNOCK DOWN, KNOCKBACK, STUN and TELEKINESIS.",
    "MOVER_X": "The target can Move up to X squares following the normal Movement rules (page 22).",
    "MOVER_MAS_X": "You receive X additional Movement points each time you receive a Move effect.",
    "NO_PREVENIBLE": "This damage cannot be prevented by any type of effect, including SHIELD and PREVENT. Non-preventable damage is not considered a threat, so this effect cannot be responded to with Reactions.",
    "OBJETIVO_PRINCIPAL": "A Monster's Primary Target is the character it wants to Attack during its turn. All Monsters who follow the Standard behavior choose the Strongest Hero as their Primary Target. Information about Monster behavior, turns, and other details can be found on page 38.",
    "PAGA_X_SALUD": "Some Skills drain a Hero's endurance. When a Skill requires a Hero to pay Health, they must first lose that much Health (non-preventable damage) before applying its other effects. A Hero cannot use a Pay X Health Skill if losing the Health would knock them out.",
    "PASIVA": "An Ability that is always active, unless its cube slot is blocked by a Curse or Trauma Cube.",
    "PENITENCIA": "The target takes 1 non-preventable damage for each Curse Cube they have. It is usually collateral damage.",
    "PERMUTAR": "Swapping consists of 2 elements exchanging their positions on the board. The first element immediately occupies the position that the second occupied and vice versa. Characters that enter harmful Terrain or step on Darkness for the first time this turn will suffer their effects. Each SWAP effect indicates which elements are exchanged.",
    "PERSONAJE": "\"Character\" is a word referenced by several elements of the game. Heroes, Monsters, Pets, NPC tokens, and Companions are all considered Characters for the purposes of the rules. All of them can benefit from HEAL effects, for example.",
    "PERSONAL": "Skills with this keyword can only target the character that uses them. For example: \"SELF, PREVENT 3\" means that the character can prevent 3 damage to themselves only.",
    "PNJ_FICHA": "NPC (non-player character) tokens are the people you meet in the Campaign. Some NPC tokens are used to represent your Companions on the board and others simply embody generic NPCs, such as \"villagers\" or \"children\". In any case, their tokens are Solid Elements and each time they are used they follow their own special rules. Each Adventure describes exactly how these tokens interact with the players and the current Adventure.",
    "PREVENIR_X": "Immediately ignore up to X damage that the target would take. Keep in mind that since PREVENT targets the character that takes the damage instead of the source of the damage, it is the protected character that must be within Range of this effect.",
    "PROTEGER": "This character steps in the way of any damage to protect their allies. When a character is targeted by an Attack, another character with Ward that is adjacent to them can invoke this effect. The character with Ward becomes the target of the Attack instead of the original one. It works against CLEAVE, MULTISHOT and PIERCE, but only if the character with Ward is not already a target of the Attack.",
    "PURIFICACION_X": "The target removes up to X Curse Cubes from their sheet. In addition, they remove all POISON tokens they have (only POISON is removed this way).",
    "QUEMADURA_X": "The target receives X BURN tokens. At the start of that character's next turn, they take 1 non-preventable damage for each BURN token they have and then remove 1 from their sheet. BURN is a stackable Condition.",
    "REACCION_N": "This Skill can only be used in response to a threat, which happens only when a Hero would take preventable damage. Thus, non-preventable damage cannot be responded to, but you can respond to effects even if your SHIELD tokens reduced the incoming damage to zero. Also, each Hero can use only one Reaction per threat, but two Heroes can use their Reactions combined to help a single Hero (if their effects allow it).",
    "RECOBRAR_X": "You recover up to X spent or Expended Action Cubes to your available Action Cubes box on your sheet.",
    "RECUPERAR_EL_ALIENTO": "Some effects may depend on a Hero having caught their breath during that turn. Catching your breath means recovering from being knocked out.",
    "REDUNDANTE": "A Redundant effect means that a character can only have 1 token of this effect. If a character is going to gain a second token, simply ignore it.",
    "REGENERACION_X": "At the start of their turn, a character with Regeneration recovers X Health. They cannot exceed their maximum HP.",
    "REPETIR_TIRADA": "When a Skill has REROLL, it means that if you fail a Weapon Attack made with it, you can reroll the d20 at no cost.",
    "REPRESALIA_X": "Immediately deal X damage to the Attacker. A character cannot use Retaliate against an Attack that does not include them as a target. Retaliate effects used with cubes can only affect Attackers within Range, while those made with Focus or other origins can affect Attackers at any Range. Unlike PREVENT, which targets the character you want to defend, RETALIATE targets the Attacker you want to use it against.",
    "SALTO_X": "Jumping is a special type of Movement that has some benefits. A character that jumps is not affected by the Terrain or Darkness tiles they jump over (but is affected by the one they land on), can jump over enemies, and is not affected by fall damage, although they receive no benefit from jumping from the 2nd Dungeon level to the 1st.",
    "SANAR_X": "The target regains X Health. A character can never gain more Health than their maximum value. Any excess Healing is lost.",
    "SANGUINARIO": "A Bloodseeker Monster chooses the Weakest Hero (the one with the least Health at the moment) as its Primary Target.",
    "SAQUEO": "Whenever a Companion with this collateral damage hits an enemy, if it kills it with the hit, it replaces the defeated enemy's miniature with a Chest token. This Chest is safe (if a Hero opens it they do not roll the Trap die). A Loot Chest is considered an element (but not a Solid one).",
    "SIGILO": "The target receives a STEALTH token and is considered hidden while they have it. Characters without immunity to STEALTH do not count the hidden character as either a target or an enemy for Combat purposes (they still cannot move through them if they are enemies). Hidden characters still take damage from area Attacks like CLEAVE and from Darkness. At the start of their next turn, the character is no longer hidden and discards their STEALTH token. Alternatively, like many Veteran Assassins, a character can end their STEALTH early to surprise a target. If a character with a STEALTH token makes an Attack with a Weapon ( ), whether it hits or not, they immediately lose STEALTH. On the other hand, if the Attack hits, it deals DOUBLE DAMAGE if the target considered the Attacker to be hidden. This is called \"surprising\". Characters immune to STEALTH cannot be surprised.",
    "SILENCIO": "A Hero that suffers from SILENCE must immediately EXPEND all of their available Agility and Wisdom Action Cubes. This effect is considered to be FATIGUE (characters that are immune to FATIGUE, are also immune to SILENCE and do not trigger any abilities that wouldn't be triggered by FATIGUE effects).",
    "TELEQUINESIS_X": "Move any small or Solid Element that is not an Interaction token (Traps, Chests, characters with a small base, or small Darkness tiles) up to X squares. They are not affected by the Terrain they float over, but they are affected by the one they land on. Characters moved from the 2nd Dungeon level directly to the ground floor take fall damage (2 non-preventable damage).",
    "TERRENO_DIFICIL": "A character that is affected by Difficult Terrain (like Water) loses 1 movement point from their current move effect. As with any harmful terrain, a character can only be affected by Difficult Terrain once per turn.",
    "TIRADA_X": "If you roll X or higher on your d20 during an Attack roll, (usually 16+) this bonus activates. It usually enhances the current Attack or, in some cases, triggers...",
    "TODO": "When an effect says that it PREVENTS ALL DAMAGE, or ALL DAMAGE -1, it means that its effect is relative to the damage the target takes. Thus, if a Monster deals 6 damage to a character and they receive a PREVENT ALL DAMAGE effect, the effect prevents 6 damage. Likewise, ALL DAMAGE -1 would prevent 5 damage. This word, however, does not change other aspects of the Attack resolution: Your SHIELD tokens are spent before you can use PREVENT ALL DAMAGE or ALL DAMAGE -1, and your PREVENT effect targets the character being Attacked, not the Attacking Monster. Thus, PREVENT ALL DAMAGE does not prevent multiple hits from MULTISHOT, PIERCE or CLEAVE, but only the damage that would be dealt to the target using this effect.",
    "TRAMPA": "Place a Trap token in the center of an area (blue square) adjacent to yours. The first time an enemy Activates within that area or Moves into it, the Trap triggers. All enemies in that area are affected and the Trap token is removed. There can only be 1 Trap token in an area at a time. This is an example of Trap placement. The Trap remains there until it triggers or you use the same ability to place it elsewhere. A Trap applies its effects only when it triggers.",
    "TRAMPA_PARA_OSOS": "When it triggers, it deals 2 non-preventable damage and BLEED 2 to each enemy affected by it.",
    "TRAMPA_INCENDIARIA": "When it triggers, it deals 2 non-preventable damage and BURN 4 to each enemy affected by it.",
    "TRAMPA_VENENOSA": "When it triggers, it deals 2 non-preventable damage and POISON 2 to each enemy affected by it.",
    "TRUCO_O_TRATO": "When Tharmagar is Activated, its controller chooses: a Hero within Range 1 of Tharmagar gains HEAL 2 or a Monster within Range 1 of Tharmagar suffers, at Tharmagar's controller's choice, BLEED 2, BURN 2, or POISON 2.",
    "UNICA": "This Pet is somewhat tied to the story and thus it can't be summoned to the board by any other means other than the Skill that specifically allows you to activate them. While they are summoned on the board, any other generic pet-activation Skill your Hero has works normally on them.",
    "VENENO_X": "The target receives X POISON tokens. At the start of that character's next turn, they take 1 non-preventable damage for each POISON token they have. Unlike BLEED or BURN, POISON is not removed after dealing its damage. However, when a character receives a CLEANSE effect, they also remove any POISON affecting them. POISON is a stackable Condition.",
    "VENGATIVO": "A Vengeful Monster chooses the Most Corrupted Hero (the one with the most Curse Cubes) as its Primary Target.",
    "VORAGINE": "This is an Overlord Ability. At the start of their Activation, an Overlord must add their Attack cards to the deck, shuffle it, and draw a new \"hand\" (1 card per Hero in the Adventure). Thus, the Overlord's combination of Attacks can change from round to round."
